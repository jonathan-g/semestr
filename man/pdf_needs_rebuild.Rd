\usage{
pdf_needs_rebuild(
  current_digest,
  current_dest_digest,
  old_digest,
  old_dest_digest
)
}
\arguments{
\item{current_digest}{A character vector containing digests of the
current source files (\code{.Rmd} or \code{.rmarkdown}`).}

\item{current_dest_digest}{A character vector containing digests of the
current destination (output) files (\code{.html}`).
\code{NA} for destination files that do not exist.}

\item{old_digest}{The stored digest for the source file from the last time
the site was built. \code{NA} if the source file did not exist at the time
of the last build.}

\item{old_dest_digest}{A character vector containing stored digests for the
destination files from the last time the site was built.
\code{NA} for destination files that did not exist after the last build.}
}
\value{
A vector of logicals indicating whether the destination (output)
files are out of date relative to the source files.

If a destination file is missing or if any of the digests don't match,
then the file needs to be rebuilt.
}
\description{
\code{pdf_needs_rebuild} returns a vector of logicals indicating which files
need to be rebuilt, based on whether the file has changed.
}
\details{
This function compares digests of current files to stored digests in order
to tell whether the source file needs to be rebuilt.
If the digests are not equal, then the file has changed. If a digest is
missing, then the source file is new or the output file has been deleted
and in either case, the source file needs to be rebuilt.
